Chapter_7
=========

Challenges:

1. Improve the Trivia Challenge game so that each question has a unique point value associated with it. The player’s score should be the total of all the point values of the questions he or she answers correctly.

2. Improve the Trivia Challenge game so that it maintains a highscores list in a file. The program should record the player’s
name and score if the player makes the list. Store the high scores using a pickled object.

3. Change the way the high-scores functionality you created in the last challenge is implemented. This time, use a plain text
file to store the list.

4. Create a trivia game episode that tests a player’s knowledge of Python files and exceptions.
